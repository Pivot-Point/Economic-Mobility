            </em>Economic mobility</em>: is the ability of someone to change their income or wealth. It is measured over generations or during one's lifetime. Research has found that the best way to improve one's mobility is through education, but the increasing cost of education is creating a block to those starting out in low-income families. It's a form of structural inequality that keeps the poor from improving their lives.
            
            The biggest block to mobility is widening income inequality. But race also plays a significant role, affecting black men the most. As a result, the United States has lower levels of economic mobility than other developed countries.
